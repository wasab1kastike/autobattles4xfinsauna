## Unreleased

### Major Changes
- Extended sauna tiers through the Celestial Reserve, standardizing vision radius, spawn multipliers, and NG+ unlock behavior across every hall.
- Empowered rogues with a permanent attack boost, an ambush teleport, and a first-strike damage surge covered by new combat and scenario tests.
- Launched the Hypersteam Levy Ultimatum prestige doctrine, doubling Sauna Beer production while escalating enemy aggression, cadence, and strength.
- Introduced the Glacial Gambit precision doctrine with extended range, stacked hit bonuses, brittle defensive penalties, and refreshed combat coverage.
- Deployed the Steam Debt Protocol economic edict, delivering a toggleable bond surge with accompanying documentation and regression protection.
- Rebuilt the policies console as a dedicated responsive HUD sheet, refreshed navigation to surface roster/events controls, and restored polished promotion choosers.
- Preserved NG+ carryover loadouts through a refined end-of-run overlay that trims unselected gear, persists survivors, and locks in inventory regression coverage.
- Restructured the runtime shell so the game canvas and HUD mount in dedicated containers, aligning the GitHub Pages bundle and bootstrap behavior.

### Minor Changes
- Added a persistence-aware stronghold spawner that tracks cooldown progress, restores queued activations after reloads, and ships with targeted timer regression tests.
