# Sound Effects

Short combat cues now live in `src/audio/sfxData.ts` as base64-encoded PCM WAV
payloads that the `src/audio/sfx.ts` registry decodes at runtime. The refreshed
calming palette features procedurally synthesized harp and ember textures that
rotate across multiple variations to avoid fatigue. All cues are generated by
repository tooling and remain under [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
so they can be remixed or replaced freely.

Current palette highlights:

* **Attack – Aurora harp triptych**: “Polar harp uplift”, “Midnight harp shimmer”,
  and “Aurora harp cascade” layer soft sine clusters for gentle confirmations.
* **Death – Glacial ember set**: “Glacial ember fall”, “Fjord ember sigh”, and
  “Northern ember hush” provide low, pillow-soft fades for defeats.
* **Sisu – Aurora bloom suite**: “Aurora bloom rise”, “Aurora bloom drift”, and
  “Aurora bloom linger” deliver extended, shimmering reinforcement cues.

Runtime metadata includes per-variant envelopes so each playback glides in and
out cleanly, ensuring polished presentation without shipping binary assets.

To swap in higher fidelity recordings, drop new WAV/OGG files alongside this
README and update the registry loaders. Keep contributions under a permissive
license and note attribution details here when external assets are introduced.
