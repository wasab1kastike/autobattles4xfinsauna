# Policy Arsenal

## Battle Rhythm Doctrine
- **Prerequisite:** Aurora Temperance Treaty
- **Effect:** Multiplies attack damage by 1.15, slightly extends movement range, and grants a modest +5% hit bonus while nudging upkeep 10% higher.
- **Tactics:** Keep squads in tight formation with metronomic drills that amplify frontline tempo without torching your reserves.

## Saunojas' Rage Protocol
- **Prerequisite:** Battle Rhythm Doctrine
- **Effect:** Doubles damage dealt, applies a -50% hit reliability penalty, and layers on a 40% upkeep surcharge for every deployed unit.
- **Tactics:** Toggle when you need a berserker crescendoâ€”pair with accuracy buffs or shielded initiators so the reckless swings still convert into kills.

## Shieldwall Doctrine
- **Prerequisite:** Battle Rhythm Doctrine
- **Effect:** Adds 30% defense, reduces incoming damage by 15%, and charges a flat +1.5 upkeep per unit to keep the barrier menders funded.
- **Tactics:** Anchor sieges behind condensed steam bulwarks to blunt counterattacks before unleashing your follow-up salvos.

## Sauna Skin Plating
- **Prerequisite:** Shieldwall Doctrine
- **Effect:** Halves damage taken for roster units while tripling upkeep costs via the shared policy modifier pipeline.
- **Tactics:** A high-risk, premium defensive toggle for emergency turtling or elite vanguard deployments. Pair with Shieldwall Doctrine to reach extreme damage mitigation but ensure your economy can sustain the upkeep surge.
