## Unreleased

- Rally enemy reinforcements from surviving strongholds, spawning squads on or
  adjacent to active bastions before falling back to edge entries, and cover the
  new routing with integration tests.

- Cloak newly seeded enemy strongholds in fog unless prior saves revealed them,
  keeping fresh campaigns mysterious and covering the regression with
  progression tests.
